# Memory Game

This game is a project to practice the following concepts:

- React states.
- React side effects
- React components
- Life cycle of Reactive Effects

If you want to check it out here is the [live project](https://memory-card-henna-alpha.vercel.app/)

## How to install the project

Fork the repo, refer to [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for how to fork a repository if you don't know how to do so.

After that, let's get into the folder that was just created by running in the terminal:

$ `cd memory-card/`

Then let's start the app:

$ `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react`

This will create a React app in the currently directory,
so make sure you are in the right directory (`memory-card/`)

Now you should be able to go to `http://localhost:5173/`.

Have fun !!!
